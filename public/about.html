<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Gift Kikongo, a 19 year old Software Engineering student at Eduvos and an aspiring full-stack developer.</p>

<p>My journey into tech started with curiosity and a drive to understand how software powers the world around us.
Right now, I’m learning full-stack development, building skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies.</p>

<p>I value discipline, creativity, and teamwork. My mission is to grow as a developer who builds impactful, modern applications.
Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, learning continuously, venturing, playing soccer, watching cars and spending 
quality time with my close circle of friends.</p>
